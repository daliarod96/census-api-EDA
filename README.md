# <p align="center"> Exploratory Data Analysis of Imperial County, CA using the 2021 American Community Survey </p>

# Overview

I analyzed the population of Imperial County, California through the 2021 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. I compared Imperial County with other counties in the state of California by creating and interpreting visualizations of data from the 2021 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. Specifically, I mined for information related to poverty, unemployment, and educational attainment for Latinos and other racialized or ethnic groups. I found that predominantly Latino communities like Imperial County tend to have higher rates of unemployment and poverty and lower rates of educational attainment than other counties in California. The analysis showed that educational attainment is associated with lower rates of unemployment and poverty, so I researched the state of higher education in Imperial County and offered solutions to issues that arose during my search.
