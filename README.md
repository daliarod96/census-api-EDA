# <p align="center"> Exploratory Data Analysis of the Latino Population in Imperial County using the 2021 American Community Survey through the Census API on R </p>

# Overview

I used R to analyze the Latino population of Imperial County, California through the 2021 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. I compared Latinos in Imperial County with other racialized groups in the county and all of California. Specifically, I mined for information related to poverty, unemployment, and educational attainment for Latinos and other racialized or ethnic groups. I studied the relationship between these variables, and found that Latino communities like Imperial County tend to have higher rates of unemployment and poverty and lower rates of educational attainment than other groups in California. The analysis showed that educational attainment is associated with lower rates of unemployment and poverty, so I researched the state of higher education in Imperial County and offered solutions to issues that arose during my search.
