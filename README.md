# <p align="center"> Exploratory Data Analysis of the Latino Population in Imperial County using the 2021 American Community Survey through the Census API on R </p>

# Introduction

I used R to analyze the Latino population of Imperial County, California through the 2021 American Community Survey by the U.S. Census. I compared Latinos in Imperial County with other racialized groups in the county and all of California. Specifically, I mined for information related to poverty, unemployment, and educational attainment for Latinos and other racialized or ethnic groups. I studied the relationship between these variables, and found that Latino communities like Imperial County tend to have higher rates of unemployment and poverty and lower rates of educational attainment than other groups in California. The analysis showed that educational attainment is associated with lower rates of unemployment and poverty, so I researched the state of higher education in Imperial County and offered solutions to issues that arose during my search.

# Exploratory Data Analysis

I grew up in Calexico, CA in the rural county of Imperial. Calexico is a small town with a population of about 40,000 thousand people. The closest we have to a metropolis in Imperial County is El Centro, a slightly larger town with a Panda Express, an In-N-Out, an IHOP, and a shopping mall.

Imperial County is right next to the US-Mexico border so it has a very large Latino population. It actually has the largest concentration of Latinos out of any county in California.

California has a lot of Latinos overall, being the second largest ethnic group after White people.

Calexico, where I grew up, is made up of over 95% Latinos. As a child, I was very confused by my school textbooks that talked about the US as a diverse country and a "melting pot" of cultures. The place where I grew up in did not feel very diverse. I had only met a handful of people who were not Latino (especifically Mexican) before I moved to Los Angeles, CA to complete my undergraduate studies at UCLA.
